Rainfall prediction classifiers
This project involves building a Rainfall Prediction Classifier using machine learning techniques.

Objective:
- Predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.

Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Collect weather data with features like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, and rainfall.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and convert categorical fields into numerical formats suitable for modeling.
3. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that influence rainfall.
4. Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers to train predictive models.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models on metrics like accuracy and true positive rate using a test dataset.
6. Model Selection: Choose the best-performing model for rainfall prediction.
7. Deployment: Export the model for practical use in predicting next-day rainfall.

Technologies:
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
- Optionally Jupyter Notebook or code editors like VS Code.
- GitHub for version control and submission.

Outcome:
- A functional classifier that accurately predicts rainfall, aiding meteorological analyses and planning.

This project teaches practical skills in data science workflow, classification algorithms, and performance evaluation.
